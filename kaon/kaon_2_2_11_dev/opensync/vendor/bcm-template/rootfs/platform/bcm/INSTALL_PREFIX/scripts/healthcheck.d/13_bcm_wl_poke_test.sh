# Checks if driver is still responding in a meaningful way.
#
# If the driver doesn't respond to basic commands it's
# likely no working properly anymore and links (if any) are
# likely dead too because wpa re-keying needs to talk to
# driver via ioctls.
#
# If this is neither a transient nor one-off failure
# we need to reboot the unit to recover.
#
# This is especially important for units in GW role.
